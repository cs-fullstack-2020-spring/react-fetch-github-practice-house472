# Use react to access GitHub API

Create a react application that fetches GitHub users via the GitHub API.

Display the gitHub user name and profile image for all results returned.

You can use this endpoint 
```
https://api.github.com"users?client_id=1cb51b2524b467bb3455&client_secret=12a719d7ee5465e6105bb8fc92571d821068cb65
```

Challenges: 
* Enhance the application so you can dynamically filter the list of users by typing in a filter input field.
